### Use at your own risk. No warrenties. 
I practice human-in-the-loop computing. This workflow is designed by me to be most effective for me and my life towards my intentions. It wasn't defined with mass scalability in mind. I encourage you to persue the discovery of computing interfaces on your personel journey as well. Please feel free to take inspiration from my workflow and open dialougue in collaboration.  

# Pop-os - Gnome - Tmux - Fish - Vim - FZF - Serious Configuration - Shawn Anderson
These are the dotfiles that I hack on. Can easily be installed to your ~/.config/ by using the gnu stow utility.

They are designed to get a brand new machine into a production ready state. For me production means participating in digital platforms, writing code, and editing media.

# Popos-Gnome
In addition to the script-based configuration, I'll do my best to track and document my debian-gnome-popos settings, to make them as reproducable as possible.

Aesthetic-wise, I'm currently using the Juno-Ocean Gnome theme, as per recommended by @mattcoding4days, and my vim theme is quantum, as per Matt's recommendation as well.

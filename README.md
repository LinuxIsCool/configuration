# Dotfiles of Shawn Anderson
A repository the dotfiles that I hack on. Can easily be installed to your ~/.config/ by using the gnu stow utility.

To install:  
1. Clone the repo  

	git clone git@github.com:LinuxIsCool/dotfiles.git  
	
2. Symlink into ~/.config using stow  

	cd dotfiles  
	sh stow
	
	
# Popos
In addition to the script-based configuration, I'll do my best to track and document my debian-gnome-popos settings, to make them as reproducable as possible.

BTW as of Oct 22, I'm not actively maintaining these docs, as I have my machine installed and humming with my new System76 Lemur Pro. Additionally, I am diving into building with LunarVim, maintaining my own configuration, while contributing to the community.   
https://system76.com/laptops/lemur    
https://www.lunarvim.org/   

I havn't added my LunarVim config here yet as I am still in experimentation mode, rapidly picking up the platform and how to customize it to highest compatibility. Working on that now as I continue to develop. 

# Use at your own risk. No warrenties. 
I practice human-in-the-loop computing. This workflow is designed by me to be most effective for me and my life towards my intentions. It wasn't defined with mass scalability in mind. I encourage you to persue the discovery of computing interfaces on your personel journey as well. Please feel free to take inspiration from my workflow and open dialougue in collaboration.  

# Pop-os - Gnome - Tmux - Fish - Vim - FZF - Serious Configuration - Shawn Anderson
These are the dotfiles that I hack on. Can easily be installed to your ~/.config/ by using the gnu stow utility.

They are designed to get a brand new machine installed with https://pop.system76.com/ into a production ready state. For me production means participating in digital platforms, writing code, and editing media. I run a FinTech business in Canada called Longtail Financial, where I am in contract for providing data science and token engineering services. I work with my partner Liam Perison to drive the business towards stability and success. Please contact me if you are interested in funding Canadian Computing Technology that is driving services and products in the domain of finance, web, and computing. We practice Data Science, Token Engineering, and Software Engineering. We co-design products and services with ecoystem partners, primarily in the DAO and Token spaces.

# Popos-Gnome
In addition to the script-based configuration, I'll do my best to track and document my debian-gnome-popos settings, to make them as reproducable as possible.

Aesthetic-wise, I'm currently using the Juno-Ocean Gnome theme, as per recommended by @mattcoding4days, and my vim theme is quantum, as per Matt's recommendation as well.

" Now that I actually know what I'm doing in vim (somewhat) I'm starting a new
" config from scratch that will be the amalgamation of all the vim tricks and
" tweaks that I have accumulated over the years. Development is in close
" collaboration with Matthew Williams, whom I have been having a lot of vim
" discussions with lately. Original plugin count: Matt-28 Shawn-39. Only 10
" overlapping. Matt had the deprecated nerdtree and Shawn had the deprecated
" nerdcommenter. In these cases the author has changed to preservim from
" scrooloose.
